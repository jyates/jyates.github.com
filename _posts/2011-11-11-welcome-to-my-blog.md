Hi, I'm Jesse. If you are reading this, you probably got here after reading one of my other posts. Congratulations on being one of the few people compelled to read _everything_. 

In case you haven't gathered from some of the posts here, I really like playing with Big Data. As in, I really believe it can change (is changing?) the world. Right now I'm working on a way do that, but more on that later - let's just call it in 'stealth mode'.

So if you like hearing about big data, cloud, programming, entrepreneurism, and  (among other things) general nerding out, stick around!
