On November 30th I'll be racing Ironman Cozumel.

You can follow the live coverage --------> [here](http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/coverage/live.aspx#axzz3JHpmhanF) <--------

I'm number 418.

I'll be updating as I can - not sure about internet down in Mexico.

Yes. Ironman.

That's a 2.4 mile swim, followed by a 112 mile bike ride and then a 26.2 mile run (or as its more commonly known, a marathon).

And lets not forget that Cozumel at this time of year is a balmy 85F with 100% humidity and headwinds that will knock you around like a toy.

So it's looking like a fun day out :)

And it hasn't been an easy journey - here's the numbers from the last 8 months of training:
 
 * 450+ hrs Total
 * 120hrs of swimming - 160,000 yds
 * 240hrs of cycling - 3600 mi
 * 90hrs or running - 575 mi

And that's just in training hours. It doesn't take into account time foam rolling, sports massage and doing pyhsical therapy.

I've been incredibly lucky to have supportive people in my life that enable me to do it - my loving girlfriend Megan for putting up with everything, my friends for still wanting to hang out (even if its just once a month and all I talk about is training) and my tri club for helping feed the addiction.
