title: The Worst Case

# {{title}}

November 22, 2011 - Seattle, WA

So I'm sitting here in SeaTac Airport for the second time in as many weeks, on my way home for the holidays, and I can't help but be be think of a saying my friend [Haris] (http://www.syedharisali.com) and I have been using recently: "Just go and do it. The worst case is your life stays exactly the same."This is something that has been my on mind frequently over the last couple months as I try to figure out the next steps for my life. 

I recently moved to Seattle, jumped into the startup community here, am thinking about starting to my own company/joining a startup, and basically have had my head spinning like a top. Between working two jobs (part of trying out my 'Consulting Startup for Startups' idea - currently dropped as it just doesn't make much sense), contributing to open source projects ([Hbase](http://org.apache.hbase) and [Accumulo](http://incubator.apache.org/accumulo/)), trying to stay in shape/train for a marathon, and trying meet new people in a new city its been a pretty crazy couple of months.  Don't get me wrong it has been a heck of a lot of fun, but also completely exhausting. 

Being in the startup community means around people who are laser focused and think simultaneously in the 1-2 month AND 5-10 year timeframes. They worry about making sure the company has a product, can get clients, can get funding, etc AND also thinking about making the right moves now so in 5 years they are positioned for global domination, killing Google or Facebook or Oracle, or just changing the world.

Its hard not to get sucked into that world, especially for A-type people who _have to build_ to be happy.

So all of a sudden I was in a very competitive market, with a lot of options to do stuff _fun_. Everything is then a good option. Turns out then, the worst case is if your life stays the same. For me, that isn't an option I would be happy with - time for some real change. Continuing on the same path would cause me lose my mind - why do you think I was doing so many things on the side? But I came to realize that spending 40 hours a week doing something you don't absolutely love is no way to live. No one wants to hear you complain about it and you aren't even going to be happy in the other aspects of your life. Time to really look into these options.

Before moving, I had a perspective on life looking to the next year and not thinking about concrete, long-term goals, but rather "I want to be THERE doing X". That is totally ok for a twenty-something just getting out into the world. However, not thinking more deeply about what you want means you are going to be skipping from one thing to the next. And hey, that could be just fine. But for me, I need structure and goals - somewhere to be (A-type, remember?).  Interestingly, having all the options for my next step actually forced me of the one-hop lookahead to instead the 3-5 year lookahead (still arguably only two to three hops out).

I couldn't do anything really 'wrong', just potentially not as great. Turns out not as great is mainly influenced not rally by where you are right now, but where you want to be down the road. Its probably apparent to older folks, but recently I've had to take a hard look at _really_ where I want to be in two years, in five years; 10 still feels like a ways out, so I can again label it as 'doing awesome stuff at a cool place'. Okay, so that took about a week of introspection to build a solid plan (solid enough - it still changes weekly, but the basic scaffolding is there). So once you have that end point, just start splitting the time in half until you figure out where you need to be. If I want to be Z in 5 years, then in two-ish years, I need to be doing Y and then to be at Y I need to do X next, and then etc...

 I found I not only have a map for what I want my life to look like, I literally am writing my own story. Yeah, it sounds cheesy, but I've found thinking about it as something to tell in retrospect helps make sure that you do something you can be proud of, something you are happy retelling time and again.

And it all comes from being in a situation that generated the options to allow me to see that change is not only possible, but necessary. That life is not meant to be walked through but instead danced and run and played. If you are comfortable, then chances are you are bored (some exceptions obviously apply). 



This isn't a phenomenom limited to the startup world, but something you can see in all walks of life. If you are do good, then good things will come to you (not be preachy). However, the options only tend to appear 'serendipitously' (future post about that) when you are actually looking for them, going out and creating situations for the good things to happen to you. 



Sitting in your basement, hacking all day isn't going to bring any changes, you have to go out and let the world know you want change. If you do, I woud bet 10:1 that people are going to come knocking. 

But I digress slightly. 

Unfortunately, it frequently doesn't turn out that way (the plans of mice and men, right?). Two years ago I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted - now its totally changed. However, here is the important thing - THAT'S OK. What's really important is being able to make the decision of what to do next being a decider (insert your own G.W. Bush joke here).

What's cool here is since you know where you want to end up (kinda), you have the opportunity to write your own story (future post on that too). So you can craft it so it looks not only like you made this massive moves, but that you were brilliant to even see them. It all starts with those baby steps of figuring out what's next to get you where you want to be.

Think about in 30-40 years, sitting around the hyper-television drinking your future-scotch, telling your kids/grandkids about your life story. You want it to be fun, exciting, and smattered with some life lessons. You _do_ want to be cool parent, right? That means taking some risks, diving in head first when the time is right (and sometimes not), and basically writing your own story. Because you know what? If you don't, thats going to be one heck of a boring story. 

What you really want is be to having tons of fun, passionate (look for a post on that too) about every aspect, and in love with your life. Because if your not, you are cheating yourself out of being happy and a really great story.

So yes, start that company. Find the job that will make you happy. Grab a beer with your friends. Talk to that cute guy/girl at the coffee shop. Write your own story. 

"Just go and do it. The worst case is that your life stays exactly the same."
