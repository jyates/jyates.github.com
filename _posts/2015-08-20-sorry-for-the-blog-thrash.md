Don't know if you noticed, but there may haven been a bunch of RSS thrash from updates to my [maven shade post](/2015/08/17/using-maven-shade-to-run-multiple-versions-in-a-jvm.html). Jekyll had updated some dependencies, which made my local jekyll instance's output not even nearly match the actual, leaving me to test 'in production'... admittedly not great a blog + rss.

Anyways, it should all be working smoothly now (post coming soon to help verify that). Also today, I should be pushing a highlighting-fixed version of the maven-shade post - let's hope its the last.
