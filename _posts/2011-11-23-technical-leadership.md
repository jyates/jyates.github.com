# Technical Leadership
November 23, 2011 - Gaithersburg, MD

Yesterday I was talking with a potential future boss and was talking about what I was looking for in my next position. One of the things I mentioned was I wanted the a technical leadership role. Now, to someone already in managment who has been around for a while will naturally be a little suspicious as they should be. The very first thing he asked me was, "So why do you want to be a lead? Because you then have power to boss people around?"

Being a leader is stressful, hard, and often times filled with minutae not immediately related to the project. In short, it can really suck. 

So why in the world would people want to be leader? When it comes down to it, it really means control. Control over the vision, the execution and the final product. It is the chance to fix the problems that you have seen in previous projects. It's the chance to nurture your developers and watch them grow. Its about getting to that feeling of project 'flow' and knowing you enabled. But in the end, it is the chance to build something bigger than you can alone - having a vision and building something impactful from scratch.

Coming from being a developer, it really is just a higher level abstraction on the system of building systems. Which means yes, you have to have authority to 'boss people around'. Otherwise, you cannot orchestrate (and I chose that word intentionally) the system to suceed, to reach its full potentially.

But with great power comes great responsibility.

That responsiblity is to building a great product. What does that mean? The first is responsibility to your team. Its becomes your job to enable them to succeed. That entails a multitude of things: providing cover from "bs" work, making sure people have work to do, ensuring the project is synchronized, that right people are working on the right things and ensuring that all their hard work gets communicated back up to managment. Making it easy for your team to suceed makes it easier for them to build something great. This also means helping where necessary and (this is harder) stepping back and letting the really smart people just work. 

If everything is good, the team should feel like its skimming on butter. There are no major hitches. Everything is clicking with the developers. Work is being getting done on sprint boundaries (+/- technical difficulties). But this is a hard thing to get to, and there are a lot of tools and books out there to help leader just let developers write code (agile, xp, cms, etc.), so clearly this isn't a solved problem. Hey, writing software is a craft not engineering (nor did anyone say it was easy). 

There are risks in any project and things can fall behind because of unexpected delays. If that's the case, the lead needs not to crack the whip - that will only break spirits over time, though it may get _this_ project done - but instead make sure everyone (the team, management, the client) understands what's going on and why this happened. Its all about communication, about making sure everyone knows what's happening with the project.

The worst thing that could happen is people thinking that everythink is hunky dory, when in fact they are going off the rails. This leads to people being angry, a shoddy product, an overworked team, or some combination of the previous. 

As a lead, your main job is really to facilitate communcation. Make sure the developers are talking and coordinated. Make sure the client knowns whats happening. Make sure upper management is apprised of the project status. No suprises. 

So we've talked about the responsilibities (and there is no lack of them). Now let's talk about why you would even want to be a technical lead. Its the opp
